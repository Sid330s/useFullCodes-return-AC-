MLSC's Busy Schedule

MLSC VIT Pune is a tech community functioning under the wing of Microsoft.
MLSC's mission is to help, educate and enhance tech & career skills of it's members.
MLSC performing well and getting lots of tasks day by day. MLSC's head have a long list of tasks that he need to do today.
To complete a task (i) he need (Mi) minutes, and the deadline for this task is (Di) .
He need not complete a task at a stretch.
He can complete a part of it and switch to another task and then switch back.
He have realized that it might not be possible to complete all the tasks by their deadline.
So He decide to do them in such a manner that the maximum amount by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline is minimized.

Input Format

The first line contains the number of tasks (N).
Each of the next (N) lines contains two integers (Di) and (Mi).

Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Di <= 10^5
1 <= Mi <= 10^3

Output Format

Output (N) lines. The (i th) line contains the value of the maximum amount by which a task's
completion time overshoots its deadline, when the first tasks on his list are scheduled optimally.

Sample Input

5
2 2
1 1
4 3
10 1
2 1

Sample Output

0
1
2
2
3

Explanation

The first task alone can be completed in 2 minutes, and so you won't overshoot the deadline.

With the first two tasks, the optimal schedule can be:
time 1: task 2
time 2: task 1
time 3: task 1

We've overshot task 1 by 1 minute, hence returning 1.

With the first three tasks, the optimal schedule can be:
time 1 : task 2
time 2 : task 1
time 3 : task 3
time 4 : task 1
time 5 : task 3
time 6 : task 3

Task 1 has a deadline 2, and it finishes at time 4. So it exceeds its deadline by 2.
Task 2 has a deadline 1, and it finishes at time 1. So it exceeds its deadline by 0.
Task 3 has a deadline 4, and it finishes at time 6. So it exceeds its deadline by 2.

Thus, the maximum time by which you overshoot a deadline is 2. No schedule can do better than this.

Similar calculation can be done for the case containing 5 tasks.
